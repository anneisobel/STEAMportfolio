    <h2>Teaching Context</h2>
    <h3>About the Teacher</h3>
      <p>I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelors of Science in Packaging Science. I currently teach at an engineering-focused boarding school in Japan. This is my first teaching position and I have been teaching for about three years. In this position, I facilitate the evening Learning Session and teach first- and second-year high school students across all course subjects. The students take most of their classes in English, so I primarily teach in English as well.</p>
    <h3>Teaching Setting</h3>
      <p>
        The timing of implementing the STEAM unit for this course unfotunately took place during the summer vacation for the students at the school in Japan. Due to the requirement of implementing the STEAM unit during September, separate arrangements had to be made in order to ensure that this was possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the school in Japan, I arranged to teach my STEAM unit as an optional course in the extracurricular schedule. Students were required to return to campus in early September, but there were no classes and only extracurricular activities during this time. Due to the elective nature of these activities and the unfortunate scheduling of 4 out of 6 classes taking place in the first period, there was no guarantee that students would attend my STEAM course and a fairly good chance that few, if any, students would show up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, due to the uncertainty, another set of arrangements were made. Working with my father, a children's pastor in Houston, Texas, I recruited sixth graders for an online Introduction to Engineering workshop. The arrangements were fairly last-minute, but the families were cooperative and the workshop schedule was planned around the students' existing schedules.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these arrangements in place, I taught two separate STEAM units throughout the same three-week period. One was taught (mostly) in-person at the school and the second was taught completely online over Zoom.
