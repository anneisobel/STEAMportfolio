    <h2>Stink Bugs!</h2>
    <p id="subtitle">
      A STEAM Unit Written for Students at the Engineering School in Japan
    </p>
    <p>This STEAM unit was taught over six 100-minute classes throughout a three-week period. The first class took place over Zoom because students were still quarantined, awaiting PCR test results. The rest of the classes were taught face-to-face.
    </p>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>Problem Scenario</h3>
    <p>
      The brown marmorated stink bug is an insect that releases an odor as its defense mechanism. It feeds on many plants and when feeding on fruit, it leaves marks so the fruit can no longer be sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have noticed that we have many stink bugs on our campus, both inside and outside. These stink bugs are distracting in class and when studying and make it unpleasant to walk around our campus. It can be difficult to get rid of them
      without releasing the stinky smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research about the stink bug, including the damage it can cause, and work with your team to create a way to improve the stink bug situation on our campus. Be prepared to present your research and creation or plan to the school office and
      include instructions to teach your classmates how to use your creation or be a part of the solution.
    </p>

      <h4>Reflection: Designing the Unit</h4>
      <p>
        This unit was written to encourage students to investigate and solve a problem that is encountered yearly at our school. Many of our students come from the city, but our boarding school campus is located in the mountains. It is quite rural
        here and so naturally, we have many more critters sharing our living and working spaces than one might like. Every year, stink bugs invade our campus and can be found everywhere both inside and outside the buildings. There is usually quite a
        lot of yelling and screaming about bugs on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The timing of this unit in September was meant to coincide with when the stink bugs start appearing. However, this year, the stink bugs are later than usual. We suspect because it is still warm and hasn't gotten colder yet. Therefore,
        throughout the implementation of the unit, some wording had to be changed and a few activities adjusted slightly to work with the current conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The driving questions were written to help guide students in their research and thinking as they designed their own solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The format of the unit itself was designed to be similar to the format and flow of the Engineering Design class here at the school. The Engineering Design class usually follows the design thinking process as they move through various PBL
        units where students design or create something. However, in this STEAM unit, I presented the problem scenario to follow the engineering design process instead. The main difference between the design thinking process and the engineering
        design process is that the design thinking process focuses more on the user of the design/creation and designing for that target user while the engineering design process focuses more on the problem and the solution to that problem.

    <h3>Class 1: Unit & Class Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Five students joined the first class over Zoom.
    </p>
    <p class="reflect">
      Prior to starting the class, I wasn't at all sure that any students would show up. I had sent out an email to all of the students and also a message through our Discord server, but had received no responses from students. Thus, I was presently
      surprised to have five students present for the first class. They did trickle in over the first 20 minutes, so we did not begin immediately, as I wasn't sure there would be enough students for the class. For the first 20 minutes, we chatted
      about packaging engineering, my undergraduate major. When it was clear that I would have enough students to teach the class, I immediately began teaching the unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      After introducing the class (why I was teaching the class and what we would be doing), we moved straight into the first formative assessment: mind mapping the topic of stink bugs. After the initial mind mapping, I introduced the problem
      scenario and the project to the students. Following this, students returned to their mind maps to add more and to annotate their mind maps based on what they thought might be worth researching more or might be important information for their
      project.

    </div>
    <p class="reflect">
      I was mostly pleased with the students' work on the mind maps. Most of them had some good thoughts laid out on their mind maps, along with their own feelings toward stink bugs. Unfortunately, one student (M) apparently spent about 10 or 15 minutes hearing "bags" instead of "bugs." His mind map is less focused, although not unexpected with his personality.
      <br><br>
      Because the number of students was small and the class was mixed with both first-year and second-year students, I decided to allow students to choose whether they wanted to work individually or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three students (C, S, SH) decided to work individually for this project, while two (R, M) paired up as a team.<br><br>
      We then moved into research. As students began their research, the driving questions were displayed on the shared PowerPoint to help students guide their research and thinking. After about 15 minutes of research, students shared 1-3 things they had learned from their research thus far. Every student, except M, was able to share a bit and students were then directed back to their mind maps to add what they had learned.
      <br><br>
      With a bit of research done, students then worked on writing questions for K, our guest expert, who would join us for our next class. K is a member of the maintenance team at the school, as well as a rice farmer in the local area. Each student wrote two questions and questions were written in Japanese as K does not speak English. Because one of the first-year students is an international student whose first language is not Japanese, he wrote his questions in Japanese and one of the second-year students helped him translate them to Japanese. Most of the students wrote very good questions about stink bugs, other pests, and methods to deal with pests. M chose to ask about the possibility of eating stink bugs.
      <br><br>
      Class was concluded after students finished preparing questions for K. When asked if they would continue coming to the class, all the students said yes.
