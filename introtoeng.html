    <h2>Introduction to Engineering</h2>
    <p id="subtitle">
      <em>An Online STEAM Unit Written to Introduce 6th Graders to Engineering</em>
    </p>
    <p>This STEAM unit was promoted as a special STEAM workshop for middle schoolers with the purpose of introducing the students to engineering. It was taught to a group of sixth graders over four 90-minute sessions throughout a two-week period. Each session was taught online over Zoom. Students participated from home or from church using computers, iPads, and/or iPhones.</p>

    <h3>Problem Scenario</h3>
    <p>
      Look for a problem you can solve in your life or around you. Design a solution and present it to your classmates.
    </p>
    <h4 id="subtitle">Driving Questions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        What is engineering?
      </li>
      <li>
        How do engineers view the world?

    </ol>

      <h4>Reflection: Designing the Unit</h4>
      <p>
        This unit was written with the goal of introducing students to engineering and to the engineering design process. As such, the problem scenario was purposely written to be vague and very open. The first step in the engineering design process is to "identify the problem." One of the goals of this unit was to teach students to view the world as engineers do and learn how to identify problems. Therefore, no specific problem was presented in the problem scenario. Students were responsible for discovering problems to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The driving questions were written to prompt students to "Think like an engineer!" and were used as reminders throughout the workshop as students worked through the engineering design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was actually very excited to teach this class. I've only been teaching high schoolers for the past few years and haven't had any experience teaching other ages outside of a church setting. I even arranged for more than one guest expert: engineers who I studied with in university.

  <h3>Before the Workshop</h3>
  <p>
    Before the workshop even began, as part of the registraton for the workshop, students filled out a survey, answering a few questions about themselves and what they know about engineering so far. This was the first formative assessment, serving as a short pre-assessment on the students' prior knowledge and expectations related to engineering.

    <h3>Session 1</h3>
    <div class="reflect"><p>
      Before I began the first session, my dad, a children's pastor in Houston who helped me recruit the students, warned me about a few settings that I would need to change in Zoom. Chat permissions had to be changed so that participants could chat only with the host and annotations for screen sharing turned off. He said there was a good chance they would flood the chat with copy-pasted text or links and draw on the screen share. This is something that has never been necessary with my high school students. So I changed the settings and mentally prepared myself to teach an age group that might have more distracting behavior.
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Seven students were signed up for the workshop, but I had eight students show up instead. The students trickled in one-by-one, joining the Zoom with different devices. Most had their cameras off to start, but were asked to turn their cameras on. Some did turn their camera on while positioning it so that I could only see the top of their heads.
    </p>
    <div class="reflect">
      <p>
        I asked for the students to have their cameras on so that I could see their faces. While the students might have an idea of who I am, I didn't have any rapport or personal relationships with them and didn't know them. With so little information about who the students are as individuals, I wanted as many clues as possible during the session itself so that I could get to know them, see their reactions, and try to gauge their understanding.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      To begin, I introduced myself and the workshop. I explained the learning objects and our planned activities for the day.
    </p>
    <img src="Media/introtoeng/learning objectives.png" alt="Learning objects in the PowerPoint" />
    <p>
      First, we addressed the question "What is engineering?" We reviewed some of the students' answers on the sign-up survey (anonymously), and concluded that "Engineering is solving problems." Following this, I taught the students about the four main types of engineering: chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical. We connected the various types of engineering to a few of the large industries or well-known companies in Houston, including the oil industry and NASA. We also looked at a list of other types of engineering and emphasized that there are many different types of engineering and they work on different types of issues, but they all solve problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, we explored how engineers look at the world. We started by looking at a picture of a chair and students shared what they saw.
    </p>
    <img src="Media/introtoeng/chair slide.png" alt="'What do you see?' chair slide in the PowerPoint" />
    <p>
      After concluding that everyone saw a chair, we discussed what engineers think about when they look at the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, we moved to Miro, to look at the chair from an engineer's point of view. Although our discussion was successful in the end, using Miro with this group of students proved to be chaotic. Still, the students were able to successfully identify the different parts of a chair, how those parts interact, and how a user interacts with a chair and its different parts. We discussed how each of the different parts works with the other parts, how forces interact with the parts of the chair, and why each part is important.

      </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now that the students were introduced to engineering and how engineers view the world, we introduced them to an actual engineer. A, a manufacturing engineer at Johnson & Johnson, joined to tell the students a little about why he became an engineer, his field of engineering, and what he does everyday as an engineer.
