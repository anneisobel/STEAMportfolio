    <h2>Introduction to Engineering</h2>
    <p id="subtitle">
      <em>An Online STEAM Unit Written to Introduce 6th Graders to Engineering</em>
    </p>
    <p>This STEAM unit was promoted as a special STEAM workshop for middle schoolers with the purpose of introducing the students to engineering. It was taught to a group of sixth graders over four 90-minute sessions throughout a two-week period.
      Each session was taught online over Zoom. Students participated from home or from church using computers, iPads, and/or iPhones.</p>

    <h3>Problem Scenario</h3>
    <p>
      Look for a problem you can solve in your life or around you. Design a solution and present it to your classmates.
    </p>
    <h4 id="subtitle">Driving Questions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        What is engineering?
      </li>
      <li>
        How do engineers view the world?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="reflect">
      <h4>Reflection: Designing the Unit</h4>
      <p>
        This unit was written with the goal of introducing students to engineering and to the engineering design process. As such, the problem scenario was purposely written to be vague and very open. The first step in the engineering design process
        is to "identify the problem." One of the goals of this unit was to teach students to view the world as engineers do and learn how to identify problems. Therefore, no specific problem was presented in the problem scenario. Students were
        responsible for discovering problems to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The driving questions were written to prompt students to "Think like an engineer!" and were used as reminders throughout the workshop as students worked through the engineering design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was actually very excited to teach this class. I've only been teaching high schoolers for the past few years and haven't had any experience teaching other ages outside of a church setting. I even arranged for more than one guest expert:
        engineers who I studied with in university.

    <h3>Before the Workshop</h3>
    <p>
      Before the workshop even began, as part of the registraton for the workshop, students filled out a survey, answering a few questions about themselves and what they know about engineering so far. This was the first formative assessment, serving
      as a short pre-assessment on the students' prior knowledge and expectations related to engineering.

      <h3>Session 1</h3>
      <div class="reflect">
        <p>
          Before I began the first session, my dad, a children's pastor in Houston who helped me recruit the students, warned me about a few settings that I would need to change in Zoom. Chat permissions had to be changed so that participants could
          chat only with the host and annotations for screen sharing turned off. He said there was a good chance they would flood the chat with copy-pasted text or links and draw on the screen share. This is something that has never been necessary
          with my high school students. So I changed the settings and mentally prepared myself to teach an age group that might have more distracting behavior.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Seven students were signed up for the workshop, but I had eight students show up instead. The students trickled in one-by-one, joining the Zoom with different devices. Most had their cameras off to start, but were asked to turn their cameras
        on. Some did turn their camera on while positioning it so that I could only see the top of their heads.
      </p>
      <div class="reflect">
        <p>
          I asked for the students to have their cameras on so that I could see their faces. While the students might have an idea of who I am, I didn't have any rapport or personal relationships with them and didn't know them. With so little
          information about who the students are as individuals, I wanted as many clues as possible during the session itself so that I could get to know them, see their reactions, and try to gauge their understanding.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        To begin, I introduced myself and the workshop. I explained the learning objects and our planned activities for the day.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/learning objectives.png" alt="Learning objects in the PowerPoint" />
      <p>
        First, we addressed the question "What is engineering?" We reviewed some of the students' answers on the sign-up survey (anonymously), and concluded that "Engineering is solving problems." Following this, I taught the students about the four
        main types of engineering: chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical. We connected the various types of engineering to a few of the large industries or well-known companies in Houston, including the oil industry and NASA. We also looked at
        a list of other types of engineering and emphasized that there are many different types of engineering and they work on different types of issues, but they all solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we explored how engineers look at the world. We started by looking at a picture of a chair and students shared what they saw.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/chair slide.png" alt="'What do you see?' chair slide in the PowerPoint" />
      <p>
        After concluding that everyone saw a chair, we discussed what engineers think about when they look at the world.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/engineer POV.png" alt="'Engineers think about:' slide in the PowerPoint" />
      <p>
        At this point, we moved to Miro, to look at the chair from an engineer's point of view. Although our discussion was successful in the end, using Miro with this group of students proved to be chaotic. Still, the students were able to
        successfully identify the different parts of a chair, how those parts interact, and how a user interacts with a chair and its different parts. We discussed how each of the different parts works with the other parts, how forces interact with
        the parts of the chair, and why each part is important.
      </p>
      <div class="row2">
        <div class="column2">
          <img src="Media/introtoeng/miro 1.png" alt="Miro workspace" style=width:100%>
        </div>
        <div class="column2">
          <img src="Media/introtoeng/miro 2.png" alt="Miro workspace zoomed out" style=width:100%>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="reflect">
        <p>
          Miro did not at all turn out how I expected. In my Stink Bugs! unit, the students used Miro well and we had minimal issues. However, to my surprise, with the sixth graders, it very quickly devolved into chaos. I had some prior warning, but
          didn't really realize how it would affect using Miro. I had hoped to use it in the way you would normally use a real whiteboard, having students write their answers in the same space. Instead, we had giant text, small text, comments, notes,
          lines, numbers, etc. It really was an experience.
          <br><br>To combat the chaos, I did my best to ignore it and addressed only the serious answers, moving on with the discussion. In this way, it didn't really sidetrack the discussion very much, although, on my end, I was frantically trying
          to figure out if I could somehow freeze everyone's cursors while I talked. I didn't find a way to do this, so I will need to look deeper into Miro's settings later, or find a different option to use. I had chosen Miro because I liked the
          way it was set up and for the fact that the students would be able to access the whiteboard space without needing an account.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now that the students were introduced to engineering and how engineers view the world, we introduced them to an actual engineer. A, a manufacturing engineer at Johnson & Johnson, joined to tell the students a little about why he became an
        engineer, his field of engineering, and what he does everyday as an engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having now heard from a real-life engineer, we took a look at the engineering design process next. This is the basic process that engineers use while solving problems. It's the same process that NASA engineers use as well!
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/edp.png" alt="Engineering design process graphic" />
      <p>
        For the first session, we focused on only the first step of the engineering design process: identify the problem. Students were challenged to think like engineers to identify problems using an engineer's point of view.
        <br><br>As an example, we took a look at a spoon.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/spoon slide.png" alt="'Is there a problem? spoon slide in the PowerPoint'" />
      <p>
        Students were challenged to identify problems with a spoon, a common household object. We then looked at a problem that engineers have identified with spoons: the difficulty of using spoons with some physical disabilities. We watched
        Liftware's introduction of the stabilizing spoon to see how they solved the problem.
        <br><br>With the idea that there might always be problems we would never expect, students were introduced to their task for the workshop.
        <br><br>Students were given ten minutes to go around their own homes, making observations, asking questions, and looking for potential problems or places that could use improvement.
        <br><br>When they returned, they worked on answering the three questions to define the problem:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the problem?</li>
        <li>Who has the problem?</li>
        <li>Why is solving this problem important?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After identifying a potential problem to solve, each student shared their problem with the class. The students did very well and identified good problems that they could work on solving. Some of the problems included: uncomfortable Joy-cons,
        an unstable music stand, a backpack leaking water from the rain, turning off the lights without hands, and more.
        <br><br>We finished the class with a preview of the next session's activities.
      </p>
      <div class="STEAMelement">
        <h4>STEAM Elements: Session 1</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Science:</strong> In the discussion on how engineers might view a chair and how the different parts of a chair interact with each other or a user, we discussed a bit of physics. We talked about forces and gravity and how the chair
          must be strong enough to hold a person sitting in it.
          <br><br><strong>Technology:</strong> Since the entire workshop, all four sessions, will be held over Zoom, the effective use of technology is imperative. For this first session, PowerPoint and Zoom's screen sharing option were used to
          display the information to the students and for the guest engineer to share his information as well. Miro was also used for group collaboration and brainstorming. A video was shown to illustrate a real-world problem and solution, a
          real-world example of engineering.
          <br><br><strong>Engineering:</strong> A workshop about engineering can hardly have no engineering... We learned what engineering is, the different types of engineering, and also how engineers view the world. The students had the chance to
          practice thinking like engineers and viewing the world as engineers as they made observations around their homes and identified potential problems.
          <br><br><strong>Arts:</strong> Students practiced their communication skills when they shared the problems they had identified.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="reflect">
        <h4>Reflection: Session 1</h4>
        <p>
          I think the first session went well, with the exception of the Miro chaos. I pushed past it and continued on without acknowledging the chaos, but it was really something. Looking back on it, it's actually really funny, especially since my
          dad had warned me of what they might do. I just hadn't realized how it would apply to Miro. I probably won't use Miro again in this workshop.
          <br><br>
          Thankfully, there were few technological issues. One student's mic wasn't working, but we worked around it by having him type his contributions and responses in the chat to share. I read his message aloud so that everyone would hear.
          <br><br>
          The students didn't engage too much. I suspect it was due to the unfamiliarity with me and the workshop. I'm also unsure how many students chose to sign up and how many students were pushed to join by their parents. However, they all
          responded and engaged when called on by name. Next time, I'll jump directly to calling on students by name. Most of the sharing portions of this workshop will require all of them to share a little bit.
          <br><br>A's presentation was very informative, but I think the vocabulary might've been too advanced for the students' level. They didn't ask any questions pertaining to the engineering details of the presentation, so I'm not sure how much
          they did or didn't understand. They did ask A what he builds with LEGOs, so I know they were at least paying some attention. Personally, I enjoyed A's story of why he became an engineer and the animations illustrating how casting works.
          <br><br>The students came up with great problems that have plenty of potential for them to work on. Several of the problems were personal and a part of their lives, so hopefully that connection will help motivate them. One student was only
          able to identify one potential problem, and unfortunately, I think it is a problem that is not for him to solve this time, but for his parents or for professionals.
          <br><br>Next time, we have an engineer from Boeing joining the class. At the end of class, I asked if the students had ever heard of Boeing and they haven't, so we'll have to explain what Boeing is then.
          <br><br>I did not have the students fill out a reflection at the end of the class. I wasn't sure whether we would have time at the end or not (we ended right on time), but a reflection would've been very helpful. I will be sure to include
          one in the next session.
          <br><br>Unbeknownst to me, my mom had been listening in on the class and enjoying it greatly. After the class, she and my dad suggested that I use a project I had completed earlier this year as an example of my own utilization of the
          engineering design process. I hadn't even thought of this at all, intending to use other examples like the spoon. However, this is really a great idea to include as my own journey through the engineering design process.

      <h3>Session 2</h3>

        To start the session, I showed the students some pictures of life in Japan to give them a chance to get to know me better. After that, we went over the planned activities for the day and reviewed what we learned about in the last session. I
        asked questions pulled directly from the last session and students volunteered answers.
        <br><br>After reminding students what engineering is and to think like engineers, we welcomed the guest engineer for the day, B, a software engineer at Boeing. B introduced himself and talked about his own journey into the world of
        engineering. He explained about Boeing and the work that goes into preparing airplanes and pilots for flight. He showed them what a flight simulation looked like and explained how they use flight simulations. The students seemed quite
        interested, although the only question asked was in regard to B's cats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following B's presentation, we returned to the engineering design process. We reviewed the step we learned last session: identify the problem. This time, I introduced my own problem that I had tackled using the engineering design problem a
        few months ago. My problem was finding a way to set up a projector in my new apartment's living room with only one empty wall, a doorway, and being unable to attach things to the walls. I showed them illustrations of my project and defined my
        project using the same three questions they had answered.

      <p>
        Having reviewed the first step in the engineering design process, we moved to the next step: brainstorm solutions. After introducing them to the step and what brainstorming consists of, I applied the step to my own example and showed them my
        own brainstorming.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working with the problems they had identified during the last sesion, students then took about 15 minutes to brainstorm. They researched online to see if there were other solutions to their problem or similar problems and took notes and/or
        drew pictures. They were also encouraged to think of or look at solutions that might not be so practical. When the students returned, they shared
        their brainstorming and told us about some of the ideas they'd thought of or researched.
        <br><br>
        The next step is to select a design. Following the same format as with the previous step, we reviewed the questions engineers might ask when selecting a design and I applied them to my own example. I walked the students through my own thought
        process and selection process, until I reached the one design that I thought might work. I then showed them how I thought to modify the design I had chosen.

      <p>
        Students were given five minutes to consider their brainstormed ideas and select a design. They then shared their selected design with the class. This is the design they would continue to build on in the next session. During the sharing
        session, a couple of the students made suggestions for each other and responded to each other's suggestions as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we previewed the next session's planned activities and the students filled out the daily reflection through Google Forms.

        <p>
          <strong>Science:</strong> As students shared and disussed their selected designs, there was some discussion on types of materials that could be used based on their properties. The discussion of material properties connected us to chemistry.
          <br><br><strong>Technology:</strong> Students used their own devices and the Internet as they brainstormed possible solutions to their problems. Google Forms was also used for the daily reflection.
          <br><br><strong>Engineering:</strong> Students continued to practice thinking like engineers and viewing the world through engineers' eyes. They practiced approaching their problem and potential solutions as engineers would.
          <br><br><strong>Arts:</strong> Thoughout the brainstorming and design selection processes, students could express themselves by taking notes or drawing as they wished. They also practiced their communication skills as they shared their
          brainstorming and selected designs.

          I was less nervous with the second session, as compared to before the first session. I felt that the lesson flowed more smoothly this time, despite continuing technical difficulties and students in various locations. The student whose mic
          wasn't working was still unable to fix the problem, so we did as before and had him respond in the chat. Other students switched locations during the session and had to exit and re-enter the Zoom, but it didn't lead to any issues.
          <br><br>We did not attempt Miro again. Instead, all of our sharing and discussion was verbal only.
          <br><br>I think that the students were more interested, or at least better understood, this time's guest engineer presentation better than the first time. I took more time this time to help prepare my guest engineer before the session,
          going through his PowerPoint and vocabulary. B also has had some experience teaching kids before, so that helped. The focus of the engineering was probably something the students could connect with better, as they've all likely at least
          seen airplanes before even if they haven't flown before. However, the students may not have any familiarity with medical implants of any type.
          <br><br>The students were more engaged throughout this session. They answered questions without needing to be called on, asked questions of their own, and talked to each other during the discussions as well.
          <br><br>I'm quite pleased with their progress through the engineering design process. Next time's session might be a little tricky, as we won't be able to actually physically build their solutions.
