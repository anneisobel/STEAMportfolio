    <h2>Introduction to Engineering</h2>
    <p id="subtitle">
      <em>An Online STEAM Unit Written to Introduce 6th Graders to Engineering</em>
    </p>
    <p>This STEAM unit was promoted as a special STEAM workshop for middle schoolers with the purpose of introducing the students to engineering. It was taught to a group of sixth graders over four 90-minute sessions throughout a two-week period.
      Each session was taught online over Zoom. Students participated from home or from church using computers, iPads, and/or iPhones.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <h3>Problem Scenario</h3>
    <p>
      Look for a problem you can solve in your life or around you. Design a solution and present it to your classmates.
    </p>
    <h4 id="subtitle">Driving Questions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        What is engineering?
      </li>
      <li>
        How do engineers view the world?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="reflect">
      <h4>Reflection: Designing the Unit</h4>
      <p>
        This unit was written with the goal of introducing students to engineering and to the engineering design process. As such, the problem scenario was purposely written to be vague and very open. The first step in the engineering design process
        is to "identify the problem." One of the goals of this unit was to teach students to view the world as engineers do and learn how to identify problems. Therefore, no specific problem was presented in the problem scenario. Students were
        responsible for discovering problems to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The driving questions were written to prompt students to "Think like an engineer!" and were used as reminders throughout the workshop as students worked through the engineering design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was actually very excited to teach this class. I've only been teaching high schoolers for the past few years and haven't had any experience teaching other ages outside of a church setting. I even arranged for more than one guest expert:
        engineers who I studied with in university.

    <h3>Before the Workshop</h3>
    <p>
      Before the workshop even began, as part of the registraton for the workshop, students filled out a survey, answering a few questions about themselves and what they know about engineering so far. This was the first formative assessment, serving
      as a short pre-assessment on the students' prior knowledge and expectations related to engineering.

      <h3>Session 1</h3>
      <div class="reflect">
        <p>
          Before I began the first session, my dad, a children's pastor in Houston who helped me recruit the students, warned me about a few settings that I would need to change in Zoom. Chat permissions had to be changed so that participants could
          chat only with the host and annotations for screen sharing turned off. He said there was a good chance they would flood the chat with copy-pasted text or links and draw on the screen share. This is something that has never been necessary
          with my high school students. So I changed the settings and mentally prepared myself to teach an age group that might have more distracting behavior.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Seven students were signed up for the workshop, but I had eight students show up instead. The students trickled in one-by-one, joining the Zoom with different devices. Most had their cameras off to start, but were asked to turn their cameras
        on. Some did turn their camera on while positioning it so that I could only see the top of their heads.
      </p>
      <div class="reflect">
        <p>
          I asked for the students to have their cameras on so that I could see their faces. While the students might have an idea of who I am, I didn't have any rapport or personal relationships with them and didn't know them. With so little
          information about who the students are as individuals, I wanted as many clues as possible during the session itself so that I could get to know them, see their reactions, and try to gauge their understanding.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        To begin, I introduced myself and the workshop. I explained the learning objects and our planned activities for the day.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/learning objectives.png" alt="Learning objects in the PowerPoint" />
      <p>
        First, we addressed the question "What is engineering?" We reviewed some of the students' answers on the sign-up survey (anonymously), and concluded that "Engineering is solving problems." Following this, I taught the students about the four
        main types of engineering: chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical. We connected the various types of engineering to a few of the large industries or well-known companies in Houston, including the oil industry and NASA. We also looked at
        a list of other types of engineering and emphasized that there are many different types of engineering and they work on different types of issues, but they all solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we explored how engineers look at the world. We started by looking at a picture of a chair and students shared what they saw.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/chair slide.png" alt="'What do you see?' chair slide in the PowerPoint" />
      <p>
        After concluding that everyone saw a chair, we discussed what engineers think about when they look at the world.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/engineer POV.png" alt="'Engineers think about:' slide in the PowerPoint" />
      <p>
        At this point, we moved to Miro, to look at the chair from an engineer's point of view. Although our discussion was successful in the end, using Miro with this group of students proved to be chaotic. Still, the students were able to
        successfully identify the different parts of a chair, how those parts interact, and how a user interacts with a chair and its different parts. We discussed how each of the different parts works with the other parts, how forces interact with
        the parts of the chair, and why each part is important.
      </p>
      <div class="row2">
        <div class="column2">
          <img src="Media/introtoeng/miro 1.png" alt="Miro workspace" style=width:100%>
        </div>
        <div class="column2">
          <img src="Media/introtoeng/miro 2.png" alt="Miro workspace zoomed out" style=width:100%>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="reflect">
        <p>
          Miro did not at all turn out how I expected. In my Stink Bugs! unit, the students used Miro well and we had minimal issues. However, to my surprise, with the sixth graders, it very quickly devolved into chaos. I had some prior warning, but
          didn't really realize how it would affect using Miro. I had hoped to use it in the way you would normally use a real whiteboard, having students write their answers in the same space. Instead, we had giant text, small text, comments, notes,
          lines, numbers, etc. It really was an experience.
          <br><br>To combat the chaos, I did my best to ignore it and addressed only the serious answers, moving on with the discussion. In this way, it didn't really sidetrack the discussion very much, although, on my end, I was frantically trying
          to figure out if I could somehow freeze everyone's cursors while I talked. I didn't find a way to do this, so I will need to look deeper into Miro's settings later, or find a different option to use. I had chosen Miro because I liked the
          way it was set up and for the fact that the students would be able to access the whiteboard space without needing an account.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now that the students were introduced to engineering and how engineers view the world, we introduced them to an actual engineer. A, a manufacturing engineer at Johnson & Johnson, joined to tell the students a little about why he became an
        engineer, his field of engineering, and what he does everyday as an engineer.
      </p>
      <video src="Media/introtoeng/A presentation.mp4" controls>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
      <p>
        Having now heard from a real-life engineer, we took a look at the engineering design process next. This is the basic process that engineers use while solving problems. It's the same process that NASA engineers use as well!
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/edp.png" alt="Engineering design process graphic" />
      <p>
        For the first session, we focused on only the first step of the engineering design process: identify the problem. Students were challenged to think like engineers to identify problems using an engineer's point of view.
        <br><br>As an example, we took a look at a spoon.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/spoon slide.png" alt="'Is there a problem? spoon slide in the PowerPoint'" />
      <p>
        Students were challenged to identify problems with a spoon, a common household object. We then looked at a problem that engineers have identified with spoons: the difficulty of using spoons with some physical disabilities. We watched
        Liftware's introduction of the stabilizing spoon to see how they solved the problem.
        <br><br>With the idea that there might always be problems we would never expect, students were introduced to their task for the workshop.
        <br><br>Students were given ten minutes to go around their own homes, making observations, asking questions, and looking for potential problems or places that could use improvement.
        <br><br>When they returned, they worked on answering the three questions to define the problem:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the problem?</li>
        <li>Who has the problem?</li>
        <li>Why is solving this problem important?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After identifying a potential problem to solve, each student shared their problem with the class. The students did very well and identified good problems that they could work on solving. Some of the problems included: uncomfortable Joy-cons,
        an unstable music stand, a backpack leaking water from the rain, turning off the lights without hands, and more.
        <br><br>We finished the class with a preview of the next session's activities.
      </p>
      <div class="STEAMelement">
        <h4>STEAM Elements: Session 1</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Science:</strong> In the discussion on how engineers might view a chair and how the different parts of a chair interact with each other or a user, we discussed a bit of physics. We talked about forces and gravity and how the chair
          must be strong enough to hold a person sitting in it. Various science-related aspects also came up in the guest engineer's presentation, for example, regarding materials properties (chemistry).
          <br><br><strong>Technology:</strong> Since the entire workshop, all four sessions, will be held over Zoom, the effective use of technology is imperative. For this first session, PowerPoint and Zoom's screen sharing option were used to
          display the information to the students and for the guest engineer to share his information as well. Miro was also used for group collaboration and brainstorming. A video was shown to illustrate a real-world problem and solution, a
          real-world example of engineering.
          <br><br><strong>Engineering:</strong> A workshop about engineering can hardly have no engineering... We learned what engineering is, the different types of engineering, and also how engineers view the world. The students had the chance to
          practice thinking like engineers and viewing the world as engineers as they made observations around their homes and identified potential problems.
          <br><br><strong>Arts:</strong> Students practiced their communication skills when they shared the problems they had identified.

      <br>
      <div class="reflect">
        <h4>Reflection: Session 1</h4>
        <p>
          I think the first session went well, with the exception of the Miro chaos. I pushed past it and continued on without acknowledging the chaos, but it was really something. Looking back on it, it's actually really funny, especially since my
          dad had warned me of what they might do. I just hadn't realized how it would apply to Miro. I probably won't use Miro again in this workshop.
          <br><br>
          Thankfully, there were few technological issues. One student's mic wasn't working, but we worked around it by having him type his contributions and responses in the chat to share. I read his message aloud so that everyone would hear.
          <br><br>
          The students didn't engage too much. I suspect it was due to the unfamiliarity with me and the workshop. I'm also unsure how many students chose to sign up and how many students were pushed to join by their parents. However, they all
          responded and engaged when called on by name. Next time, I'll jump directly to calling on students by name. Most of the sharing portions of this workshop will require all of them to share a little bit.
          <br><br>A's presentation was very informative, but I think the vocabulary might've been too advanced for the students' level. They didn't ask any questions pertaining to the engineering details of the presentation, so I'm not sure how much
          they did or didn't understand. They did ask A what he builds with LEGOs, so I know they were at least paying some attention. Personally, I enjoyed A's story of why he became an engineer and the animations illustrating how casting works.
          <br><br>The students came up with great problems that have plenty of potential for them to work on. Several of the problems were personal and a part of their lives, so hopefully that connection will help motivate them. One student was only
          able to identify one potential problem, and unfortunately, I think it is a problem that is not for him to solve this time, but for his parents or for professionals.
          <br><br>Next time, we have an engineer from Boeing joining the class. At the end of class, I asked if the students had ever heard of Boeing and they haven't, so we'll have to explain what Boeing is then.
          <br><br>I did not have the students fill out a reflection at the end of the class. I wasn't sure whether we would have time at the end or not (we ended right on time), but a reflection would've been very helpful. I will be sure to include
          one in the next session.
          <br><br>Unbeknownst to me, my mom had been listening in on the class and enjoying it greatly. After the class, she and my dad suggested that I use a project I had completed earlier this year as an example of my own utilization of the
          engineering design process. I hadn't even thought of this at all, intending to use other examples like the spoon. However, this is really a great idea to include as my own journey through the engineering design process.

        To start the session, I showed the students some pictures of life in Japan to give them a chance to get to know me better. After that, we went over the planned activities for the day and reviewed what we learned about in the last session. I
        asked questions pulled directly from the last session and students volunteered answers.
        <br><br>After reminding students what engineering is and to think like engineers, we welcomed the guest engineer for the day, B, a software engineer at Boeing. B introduced himself and talked about his own journey into the world of
        engineering. He explained about Boeing and the work that goes into preparing airplanes and pilots for flight. He showed them what a flight simulation looked like and explained how they use flight simulations. The students seemed quite
        interested, although the only question asked was in regard to B's cats.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following B's presentation, we returned to the engineering design process. We reviewed the step we learned last session: identify the problem. This time, I introduced my own problem that I had tackled using the engineering design problem a
        few months ago. My problem was finding a way to set up a projector in my new apartment's living room with only one empty wall, a doorway, and being unable to attach things to the walls. I showed them illustrations of my project and defined my
        project using the same three questions they had answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having reviewed the first step in the engineering design process, we moved to the next step: brainstorm solutions. After introducing them to the step and what brainstorming consists of, I applied the step to my own example and showed them my
        own brainstorming.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/brainstorm ex.png" alt="Projector set up brainstorming" />
      <p>
        Working with the problems they had identified during the last sesion, students then took about 15 minutes to brainstorm. They researched online to see if there were other solutions to their problem or similar problems and took notes and/or
        drew pictures. They were also encouraged to think of or look at solutions that might not be so practical. When the students returned, they shared
        their brainstorming and told us about some of the ideas they'd thought of or researched.
        <br><br>
        The next step is to select a design. Following the same format as with the previous step, we reviewed the questions engineers might ask when selecting a design and I applied them to my own example. I walked the students through my own thought
        process and selection process, until I reached the one design that I thought might work. I then showed them how I thought to modify the design I had chosen.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Students were given five minutes to consider their brainstormed ideas and select a design. They then shared their selected design with the class. This is the design they would continue to build on in the next session. During the sharing
        session, a couple of the students made suggestions for each other and responded to each other's suggestions as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we previewed the next session's planned activities and the students filled out the daily reflection through Google Forms.

        <h4>STEAM Elements: Session 2</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Science:</strong> As students shared and disussed their selected designs, there was some discussion on types of materials that could be used based on their properties. The discussion of material properties connected us to chemistry.
          Some other science-related information came up in the guest engineer's presentation as well.
          <br><br><strong>Technology:</strong> Students used their own devices and the Internet as they brainstormed possible solutions to their problems. Google Forms was also used for the daily reflection.
          <br><br><strong>Engineering:</strong> Students continued to practice thinking like engineers and viewing the world through engineers' eyes. They practiced approaching their problem and potential solutions as engineers would.
          <br><br><strong>Arts:</strong> Thoughout the brainstorming and design selection processes, students could express themselves by taking notes or drawing as they wished. They also practiced their communication skills as they shared their
          brainstorming and selected designs.

        <h4>Reflection: Session 2</h4>
        <p>
          I was less nervous with the second session, as compared to before the first session. I felt that the lesson flowed more smoothly this time, despite continuing technical difficulties and students in various locations. The student whose mic
          wasn't working was still unable to fix the problem, so we did as before and had him respond in the chat. Other students switched locations during the session and had to exit and re-enter the Zoom, but it didn't lead to any issues.
          <br><br>We did not attempt Miro again. Instead, all of our sharing and discussion was verbal only.
          <br><br>I think that the students were more interested, or at least better understood, this time's guest engineer presentation better than the first time. I took more time this time to help prepare my guest engineer before the session,
          going through his PowerPoint and vocabulary. B also has had some experience teaching kids before, so that helped. The focus of the engineering was probably something the students could connect with better, as they've all likely at least
          seen airplanes before even if they haven't flown before. However, the students may not have any familiarity with medical implants of any type.
          <br><br>The students were more engaged throughout this session. They answered questions without needing to be called on, asked questions of their own, and talked to each other during the discussions as well.
          <br><br>I'm quite pleased with their progress through the engineering design process. Next time's session might be a little tricky, as we won't be able to actually physically build their solutions.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Session 3</h3>
      <p>
        As students logged on for the third session, I shared more pictures of life in Japan and answered some questions about Japan that students had asked in the daily reflection.
        <br><br>
        Once we were all ready to begin, we went over the planned activities for the session and reminded the students that "Engineering is solving problems" and to "Think like an engineer!"
      </p>
      <div class="reflect">
        <p>
          The guest engineer for the day was actually scheduled to present first, before we dived back into the engineering design process. However, due to a sudden emergency on her end, the schedule was rearranged unexpectedly and so we moved
          immediately into the engineering design process.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/session 3 edp.png" alt="Session 3: Engineering design process progress" />
      <p>
        We reviewed the steps of the engineering design process that we'd completed thus far: identify the problem, brainstorm solutions, and select a design. I reminded them of my own example and journey through the process. Then we moved to the
        next step: build a model or prototype.
        <br><br>
        The introduction of this next step followed the same format as previous steps: introduce the step and how engineers approach it and then apply it to my own example. Then the students would apply the step to their own problem and solution.
      </p>
      <div class="row2">
        <div class="column2">
          <img src="Media/introtoeng/build ex 1.jpg" alt="Projector build materials pt. 1" style=width:100%>

      </div>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/build ex 3.png" alt="Projector build sketch" />
      <p>
        However, due to the online format of this workshop and the international aspect, it was impractical to facilitate actually building the students' solutions. Instead, students were asked to determine how their solution would work, what
        materials they would choose and why, the size of their solution, and how parts connect together. These are all decisions that would be made during the designing and building of a solution. Students were also encouraged to sketch or draw their
        solutions, like in the example shown.
        <br><br>Instead of sharing their work immediately after working on it like in previous steps, the sharing would be part of the Test and Evaluate step of the engineering design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before moving on to the next step, our guest engineer for the day, T, a scientist from R&D Packaging Development at Kraft-Heinz, joined us to share about her experience in engineering. T shared about her own experience in engineering and in
        the little-known field of packaging engineering. To bring students into the world of packaging engineering, she led them through the process of developing a ketchup bottle. She identififed the different parts of the bottle, explained how
        bottles are blow molded and then tested, and also explained how packages are packaged for distribution and tested for distribution. T even gave the students a look into the filling process for Heinz ketchup. After she finished presented, a
        couple of the students asked engineering-relevant questions about the testing processes and about Heinz itself.
      </p>
      <video src="Media/introtoeng/T presentation.mp4" controls>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>

      <p>
        The next step, Test and Evaluate, was also not possible to complete in the standard way without an actual prototype to test. Since the students didn't build prototypes, we were unable to test normally. So instead, in order to evaluate the
        students' solutions, we conducted a peer review.
        <br><br>Before beginning the peer review, we went over the Test and Evaluate step and then learned about how to give feedback. Similarly to the Stink Bugs! unit, I used the 3CQ model for giving feedback. We went over the 3CQ model with
        examples of the sorts of things the students might say.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/share feedback slide.png" alt="PowerPoint slide showing guidelines for sharing and giving feedback" />
      <p>
        In order to facilitate feedback that the students could refer back to after the discussion, the feedback could not be only verbal. So a Google Doc was set up to receive feedback for each student from each of the other students.
        Questions were included to help prompt students to give feedback following the 3CQ model.
        <br><br>Because we were running late on time, only one student (AN) was able to share her problem and solution and receive feedback during this session. Her problem was that her backpack would leak in the rain, which meant her devices and
        books inside the backpack could potentially get wet. AN's solution was to create a disposable cover, made of plastic, with elastic to help the cover grip onto the backpack. She even showed a drawing of her solution. The other students typed
        their feedback into the Google Doc.

        At this point, we had run out of time so we concluded the class by previewing the next session's planned activities and filling out the daily reflection.

        <h4>STEAM Elements: Session 3</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Science:</strong> As in previous sessions, a lot of aspects of science are brought up in the guest engineer's presentation. This time, with the development and testing of packages, both chemistry and physics emerged.
          <br><br><strong>Technology:</strong> In this session, besides the screen sharing and use of PowerPoint, Google Docs was also used to help facilitate the feedback process.
          <br><br><strong>Engineering:</strong> Students continued through the engineering design process, making decisions that engineers would make, about materials, processes, connections, etc.
          <br><br><strong>Arts:</strong> Students were encouraged to make drawings during the build stage to illustrate their solutions and some of them did so.

          There were some unexpected circumstances during the session today. For one, T had to relocate during the beginning of the session due to an emergency occurring nearby. This required rearranging the schedule. Thankfully, this was not too
          difficult to do and did not affect the flow of the lesson too much. One student had to join halfway through, so his dad recorded the session for him so that he could watch it later. Another student disappeared halfway through in order to go
          finish his homework.
          The session still went smoothly, although we did run out of time at the end. I think that this is due, in part, to rearranging the schedule and to the students' typing speed. This was a foresight on my part, but it wasn't too bad. However,
          to wait for seven students to type for eight different mini-presentations would probably take a long time. Not to mention that some thinking time should be factored in as well.
          <br><br>
          T's presentation on packaging engineering went really well. I was particularly excited for this as my undergraduate major was also packaging science (we were classmates) and T was our first female engineer. I'm really glad T was able to
          join us. When I saw that we had equal numbers of male and female students, I was determined to find a female engineer to speak as well. T's presentation was easy to understand with lots of pictures and videos and clear explanation. I was
          really excited and proud that the students asked questions related to engineering this time, instead of just about hobbies or pets.
          <br><br>
          Timing next time might be tight, with finishing up the feedback, creating presentations, and presenting them all in the same session. But I am very excited to see the students' finished solutions.

    <div>
      <h3>Session 4</h3>
      <p>
        There was a lot to accomplish in this last session. Seven students were present, but one disappeared soon after the session began. As always, we started by going over the planned activities for the session and reviewing what we've learned so
        far. Reviewing the engineering design process brought us right to where we'd left off last time.
        With a quick review of the Test and Evaluate step, as well as how to give good feedback following the 3CQ model, we moved into giving feedback. Each student took a turn sharing their problem and solution, with time afterwards to answer any
        questions and for their classmates to write their feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all the students had received their feedback and taken some time to look at it, we moved into the next step: optimize the solution. Once again, I applied it to my own example and showed the students how I had to change my solution in
        order to make it work properly.
      </p>
      <div class="row2">
        <div class="column2">

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Students were then given some time to consider their feedback and consider what they might like to change or add to their solutions in order to optimize them.
        <br><br>After they optimized their solutions, we took a short break and I answered some more questions about Japan, as well as showed a video of a sushi conveyer belt at a sushi restaurant.
        <br><br>Returning to the project, I shared a video that one of my high school students in Japan had created. This video had been created to share knowledge and raise awareness of the problem of space debris, a problem that has not yet been
        solved. This video was shared to draw attention to problems in our world that have no solutions yet, as well as demonstrate one method of sharing.
        <br><br>The final step in the engineering design process is to share the solution. I explained what should be included in sharing their solutions and students were given fifteen to twenty minutes to create their presentation. I introduced <a
          href=https://www.canva.com>Canva</a> to the students, but they were free to use whatever method they chose to share their solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the time the students were creating their presentations, we were down to three students left in the session. After creating their presentations, each student shared their presentation, either through their camera or by sharing their
        screen.
        <br><br>S shared her problem of her hamster doing its business on its running wheel and the inconvenience that was caused. She showed us her drawing of the before and after: before featuring the problematic, dirty running wheel, and the after
        featuring the new running wheel designed so the pee could drip off of it.
      </p>
      <img src="Media/introtoeng/share S.png" alt="A before-and-after drawing of S's hamster wheel solution">
      <p>
        BE shared his problem of money falling out of his pockets. He created a graphic, using Canva, to show his solution of zippered pockets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, M shared his problem of uncomfortable Joy-con controllers that are not universal. He used Canva to create a short video with animation illustrating his solution of cushioned Joy-con grips.

          <br><br><strong>Technology:</strong> We utilized Google Docs to faciliate the sharing of feedback to all of the students. For their presentations, two of the students used Canva to create graphics and videos to share their solutions. One
          student used Paint to create a before-and-after graphic of her solution.
          <br><br><strong>Engineering:</strong> The students practiced thinking like engineers as they gave feedback to their classmates and considered optimization options for their own solutions.
          <br><br><strong>Arts:</strong> Students demonstrated arts-related skills in the creation of their presentations, using various tools available to them. They also practiced their communication skills through sharing their solutions, giving
          feedback, and then finally presenting their optimized solutions.

          Time was really tight for this last session. Waiting for students to finish adding feedback to the Google Docs took quite a lot of time, more than I expected. Additionally, sitting in silence in a video call proved to be a rather
          uncomfortable feeling. Three of the students (who had been in the same location) left before the session was over, but in a way, that worked out because we had less time than expected and had just enough time for the three students left to
          all share their short presentations. In the future, for online courses, I think I may need to adjust the peer review process or look at doing it in a different way.
          <br><br>I'm really proud of the students' presentations. They were all able to verbalize/describe/explain their problems and solutions effectively and illustrated their solutions in different ways. The video with animation that M made
          really surprised me and I was quite impressed.
          <br><br>We did not have a guest engineer for the last session. I had asked someone, but they were unable to make it. Still, this also worked out in regard to timing.

      <h3>Post-Implementation Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Teaching this online workshop about engineering was a lot of fun. It was full of unexpected things and teaching this age group in such a setting was new to me, but it was a very good experience.
        <br><br>In the beginning, I was really unsure of how to connect with the students and what to expect from them. I was afraid they might not find the unit engaging, especially being taught online, but they proved me wrong. Not only were they
        engaged with the unit and the engineering design process, they also asked me plenty of questions about sushi!
        <br><br>I am really glad I was able to find three engineers, all from different fields in engineering, to speak to the students. (This is the benefit of having studied engineering in university!) All three guest engineers did an excellent job
        introducing the students to different aspects of engineering. I really hope that these exposures to different kinds of engineering enriched the students' experience in this workshop. I think the students took a while to warm up to the idea of
        asking these strangers questions, but by the end, they did!
        <br><br>Inviting the guest engineers also taught me a lot about how different people communicate in different ways and about communication that is more accessible to younger students. There's more to think about when teaching different age
        groups than one might initially realize (like the Miro mishap during the first session).
        <br><br>B, the software engineer who joined the second session, left very excited about teaching kids about engineering. We are now working on planning an online coding camp, probably for 6th graders again. I'm very excited for future
        teaching opportunities!
