    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      It has been quite a journey through implementing my STEAM units. There was definitely a lot of anxiety at first, especially with the uncertainty of my teaching situation and whether students would show up at all. Even after my two classes were
      established, everyday was a roller coaster of emotions. I'd start the day anxious until I was teaching my class, then after my class, I'd feel an emotional high from the class going smoothly and having successfully finished a class session.
      That would continue until I started thinking about my teaching the next day and I'd drop into an anxious state again. It wasn't a particularly pleasant emotional roller coaster, but understandable since this is my first time teaching formally
      in an academic setting. By the last class for each unit, I was feeling more relaxed and less anxious.
      <br><br>I enjoyed planning the lessons. I'm still not comfortable in my time estimations, but I did learn a lot about flexibility and balancing timing and planned activities. When I teach next time, I think I can do a better job estimating
      time. I'd also like to put some thought into intentionally planning flexibility.
      <br><br>Teaching STEAM was a lot of fun! It was exciting to see different aspects of STEAM emerge from different parts of the project as the students worked. When STEAM elements emerged without being planned for, it felt rewarding. After
      studying and teaching STEAM, I do really like how all the elements are integrated together and approached through a real-world application. Now, I don't see at all how teaching disciplines separately would be more effective for learning. I find
      that the students build their understanding better as they approach real-world situations as a whole, rather than from just one perspective.
      <br><br>However, I definitely didn't do the best job implementing STEAM this time around. My implementation of math was weak. It did come up here and there, but only in small portions and not very concretely. Some of the things I had planned
      for the STEAM units didn't work out the way they were supposed to and this was a factor, but I think in the future, I will need to prepare more activities to implement math that I can pull into the lessons as needed.
      <br><br>Writing reflections everyday was very good practice in organizing my thoughts, noting the things I had noticed throughout the class, and adjusting my plans for the next class.
      <br><br>Even creating this portfolio was a learning opportunity. As I organized my notes, reflections, records, pictures, and videos from the past three weeks, I noticed a lot of things I hadn't seen before. I saw mistakes I had made and places
      where things lined up better than expected. Additionally, since I chose to create this website from scratch, I had the chance to relearn and reinforce my HTML and CSS coding skills.
